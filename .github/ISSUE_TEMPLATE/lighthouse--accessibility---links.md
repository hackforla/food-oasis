### Overview
The formatting of links can make them readable or unreadable by screen readers.  Which includes creating programmatic events for links without making them device specific (e.g., onfocus() instead of onmouseover(), etc.), and other ways of making sure all links are visible by screen readers.

### Action Items
*If your site already has links* review the instructions and document the changes needed to bring your link(s) into WCAG compliance, by commenting on this issue.
*If your site does not have links yet* review the instructions and design all new links using the WCAG standards.
