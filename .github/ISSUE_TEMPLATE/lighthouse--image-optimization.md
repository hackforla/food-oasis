### Overview
When you run the lighthouse review it may suggest some specific image optimizations such as choosing another image format and making those changes may or may not improve your sites actual performance.

### Action Items
Run lighthouse on a local version of the website and then apply suggested changes and retest locally before determining if you want to keep the changes.
