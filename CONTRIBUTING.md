Please see the [Food Oasis Wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/food-oasis/wiki) for detailed information.

For developers interested in making contributions for Hacktoberfest, you need to complete the Hack for LA onbarding process to participate. See the Hack for LA [Getting Started Page](https://www.hackforla.org/getting-started) for instructions.

Once you have been onboarded, see the [Contributing Code](https://github.com/hackforla/food-oasis/wiki/Contributing-Code)
information about our code workflow. The (Developers) [Getting Started](https://github.com/hackforla/food-oasis/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page has more detailed instructions for getting the project up and
running in your developent environment. In particular, note that we manage issues using the GitHub project board, so you need to go through our onboarding
process and reserve an issue to work on by assigning it to yourseld and moving it to the In Progress column, so we don't have
multiple developers working on the same issue at the same time.
