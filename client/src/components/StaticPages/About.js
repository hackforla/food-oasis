          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Access to enough food should be a basic right. Unfortunately, this
            is not the reality for millions of people in Los Angeles County.
            Before the Covid-19 pandemic, up to 1.4 million people in Los
            Angeles County faced food insecurity. Food insecurity is
            inconsistent with access to cheap and nutritious food. Los Angeles
            has the highest percentage of food insecurity in the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since COVID, 1.3 million people lost their jobs in Los Angeles
            County alone. This created a brand new vulnerable population. These
            are people who need food assistance for the first time. According to
            a study done by Feeding America in May 2020, over 500,000 Angelinos
            are newly food insecure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food pantries in the area are experiencing unprecedented demand. The
            demand for food assistance has almost doubled since the beginning of
            2020. To compound matters, it is the hard work of volunteers that
            keeps pantries and meal programs open. The number of volunteers
            available to distribute food has diminished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food Oasis has 773 organizations in our database. Our team of
            volunteers updated the information for 333 organizations. Out of 333
            organizations, 46 closed their doors and 66 closed for COVID. 37% of
            the organizations have closed their doors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary goal of Food Oasis is to provide up-to-date information
            to Angelinos. We built a directory that connects anyone with
            hundreds of free food resources. Food Oasis presents reliable
            information on a user-friendly platform. This will reduce stress and
            uncertainty for food seekers. It will also demonstrate to our
            community the growing need of food donations in Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food Oasis is creating a directory of updated food resources. There
            are countless groups helping to feed hungry Angelenos. But it’s
            difficult for those in need to find them because there’s no one
            source of updated info. We’re working to change that.

          <h2>Our Team</h2>
          <p>
            Food Oasis started in 2015 under{" "}
            <a href="//hackforla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Hack for LA
            </a>
            , a brigade under the non-profit{" "}
            <a
              href="//codeforamerica.org"

            >
              Code for America
            </a>
            . The goal was to create a site of free and subsidized food
            resources. The team gave the project to a nonprofit to manage its
            day-to-day operations. The upkeep turned out to be much more work
            than any single nonprofit could handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August 2019, our current Hack for LA team assembled to build new
            digital pieces of this puzzle. One goal was to relaunch the site
            with hundreds of new food resources. We learned from the past how
            difficult it is to keep resources updated. Now, we are training
            volunteers to update the resources in the directory. The final piece
            we added is a new second database that connects pantry directors
            with food donation organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our web-based solution is sparking collaboration, community
            building, and team building. The result of this community-building
            gives the food seeker updated information to find the free food
            resources they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are 100% volunteer-run project. We look forward to sharing our
            updated directory with Los Angeles.
